# Gemini Security Analysis Report

I have scanned the project for security vulnerabilities and found several issues. Here is a summary of my findings:

### 1. SQL Injection in `sqli/dao/student.py`

**Vulnerability:** The `create` method in `sqli/dao/student.py` is vulnerable to SQL injection. It uses an unsafe Python string formatting (`%`) to construct the SQL query, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands.

**Location:** `sqli/dao/student.py`, line 45
**Code:**
```python
q = ("INSERT INTO students (name) "
     "VALUES ('%(name)s')" % {'name': name})
```

**Recommendation:** Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. The `aiopg` library supports parameterized queries, which you are already using in other parts of your code.

### 2. Outdated and Vulnerable Dependencies

**Vulnerability:** The project's `requirements.txt` file lists several dependencies with known high-severity vulnerabilities.

*   **aiohttp 3.5.3:** Vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS), Path Traversal, HTTP Header Injection, and HTTP Request Smuggling.
*   **Jinja2 2.10:** Vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and other issues.
*   **PyYAML 3.13:** Vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) when parsing untrusted YAML files.

**Recommendation:** Update all dependencies to their latest stable versions. You can use a tool like `pip-audit` or `safety` to scan your `requirements.txt` file for known vulnerabilities.

### 3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Vulnerability:** The Jinja2 templating engine is configured with `autoescape=False` in `sqli/app.py`. This disables automatic HTML escaping, making the application vulnerable to XSS attacks. If user-provided data is rendered in templates, an attacker could inject malicious scripts.

**Location:** `sqli/app.py`, line 28
**Code:**
```python
setup_jinja(app, loader=PackageLoader('sqli', 'templates'),
            context_processors=[csrf_processor, auth_user_processor],
            autoescape=False)
```

**Recommendation:** Enable auto-escaping by setting `autoescape=True`. If you need to render HTML from a trusted source, you can mark it as safe within the template using the `|safe` filter.

### 4. Weak Password Hashing

**Vulnerability:** The `check_password` method in `sqli/dao/user.py` uses the MD5 hashing algorithm to verify user passwords. MD5 is considered a weak hashing algorithm and is not suitable for password storage. It is vulnerable to collision attacks and can be easily cracked using rainbow tables. The passwords are also not salted.

**Location:** `sqli/dao/user.py`, line 45
**Code:**
```python
def check_password(self, password: str):
    return self.pwd_hash == md5(password.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
```

**Recommendation:** Use a strong, salted password hashing algorithm like Argon2, scrypt, or at least bcrypt. The `passlib` library is a good choice for this.

### 5. Missing CSRF Protection

**Vulnerability:** The `csrf_middleware` is commented out in `sqli/app.py`. This means the application has no protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. An attacker could trick a logged-in user into performing unintended actions.

**Location:** `sqli/app.py`, line 22
**Code:**
```python
# csrf_middleware,
```

**Recommendation:** Enable and configure the `csrf_middleware` for your application.

### 6. Hardcoded Credentials

**Vulnerability:** The `config/dev.yaml` file contains hardcoded credentials for the database and Redis. This is a security risk, as it exposes sensitive information in the codebase.

**Location:** `config/dev.yaml`

**Recommendation:** Store credentials and other secrets in environment variables or use a secret management tool like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.
